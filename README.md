## THE STORY
After advancement in space travel, humans began sending satellites and radio signals further and further out into deep space looking for intelligent life. Unfortunately, one of these messages was intercepted by an alien empire bent on exerting their will across the universe. They have subjugated every other planet into paying massive taxes to fund their conquest. The message contained information on human anatomy, society, art, literature, philosophy, and history, along with our home address. With the coordinates for our planet, the aliens launched a surprise attack and conquered Earth with their superior technology. Now, they are demanding tribute, but the war has bankrupted the world economy and humanity is refusing to pay the taxes and the aliens are done asking nicely. They will use any means necessary to drain Earth of its resources to fuel their vast empire. Now, it is up to a rogue group of human resistance fighters to defend Earth from the intergalactic tax collecting menace.
